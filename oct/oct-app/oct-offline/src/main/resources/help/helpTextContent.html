    This message comes from the helpTextContent.txt file in order to be easy to change its content.
    Indentation and format (as much as it can be done in txt files.. none?) should be kept as in the text file.
    Long lines will be split on multiple lines in order to not have horizontal scrollbars. only vertical scrollbar
    should
    appear on the help dialog.

    Should display the version number as well?

    A description of how to use the offline tool would be nice to have here.
    Formatting could be done if required but then text file won't be fitted for this purpose and we will need to find
    some
    other format (html maybe)
